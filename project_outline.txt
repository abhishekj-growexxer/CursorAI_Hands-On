Tasks: Forecast daily product sales using time series models, with model selection, retraining, and fast inference.
    - Load  retail sales data.
    - Implement ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM (PyTorch).
    - Use MLflow for tracking.
    - Build a scheduled retraining job via Prefect.


Evaluation Criteria:-

Code Quality: Modular, testable, production-grade
ML Depth: Understanding of model internals, training, tuning
Prompting Skill: Effective use of Cursor to generate, debug, and improve
System Thinking: Architecture, API, monitoring, deployment
Docs & Logging: Clear README, usage logs, observability


Interesting todo:
    - Write cron-scheduled retraining DAG.
    - Write scalable DataLoaders for LSTM input.
    - Profile memory usage of model inference.
